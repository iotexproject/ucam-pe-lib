# Contributions

All contributors must first sign the [Particle Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA)], which provides the team a license to re-distribute your contributions.

Whenever possible, please follow these guidelines for contributions:

- Keep each pull request small and focused on a single feature or bug fix.
- Familiarize yourself with the code base, and follow the formatting principles adhered to in the surrounding code.
- Wherever possible, provide unit tests for your contributions.
- If the changes have an impact application developers, then those changes should be described in the documentation.
